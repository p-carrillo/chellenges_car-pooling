# Car Pooling Service Challenge By Pablo Carrillo

## Project Installation and usage.

Use `make install` to build a docker self container with the running application, 
all endpoints can be accessed in `localhost:9091`

Use `make test-unit` to run unit tests

Use `make purge` to remove all Docker images and containers from the system.

## Project structure and decisions made

- The challenge is made as a Symfony Application, I choose symfony and PHP
because they are the language and framework which I feel more confortable.
- The approach is done by ports and adapters architecture, in the src/CarPooling folder 
you can find classes as follows:
  - **Domain:** Here you can find the model and the event system 
  - **Application:** Here are Commands and handlers for each controller.
  Listeners and Services needed are also in their respective folders.
  - **Infrastructure:** Here are the Domain implementation by doctrine ORM, 
  also all the configuration needed (Routing, interface implementation and auto wiring)
  is under Framework folder. Under UI your will find the controllers for each endpoint.
  - **test**: Here are the unit testing system following the project folder structure
  - **everything else in root** Here are symfony configs, CI and docker MakeFile.
- Ports and adapters approach has been chosen due to the easy decoupling and escalation 
that this structure brig by itself. 

## Assumptions and misleads

Some assumptions and misleads have been made in the development of the application due
lack of time management:

- Shared bounded context is missing as it is a small application, so event implementations 
are inside CarPooling context, and they shouldn't
- Command bus implementation is not decoupled from Infrastructure, I did leave this for 
the last days and finally run out of time.
- Input validation are in their respective controllers, they should be also decoupled under 
an Input folder in Infrastructure UI
- Exception are not managed under Domain, but with the raw exceptions types given by the 
framework. They should be declared under Domain throw from handlers or services and 
be called from Controllers, implementing also custom outputs for each of them.
- Commits are a mess. I started to code in a private repository and finally didn't have 
time to remade them properly. Bad decision indeed.
- Not all application is unit tested.
- No Integration tests has been made as acceptance stage in CI make the job they are meant.
- Dockerfile is copy/pasted form the internet to make the project work. Couldn't manage
to make it work by myself. Though you can see my tries under the endless test commits done.

## Final Thoughts

I really enjoyed the challenge, has been a great opportunity to make a hexagonal symfony
project from scratch, as I had always been working in already developed product companies.

The hardest part of the development was indeed the initial configuration of the project,
like installing and make work things commandbus and events. Dockerize and understanding
the gitlab CI was also a challenge.

And that's all, thank you very much for the opportunity given, and thanks also in advance 
for your time evaluating the challenge.

# Car Pooling Service Challenge

Design/implement a system to manage car pooling.

At Cabify we provide the service of taking people from point A to point B.  
So far we have done it without sharing cars with multiple groups of people.
This is an opportunity to optimize the use of resources by introducing car
pooling.

You have been assigned to build the car availability service that will be used
to track the available seats in cars.

Cars have a different amount of seats available, they can accommodate groups of
up to 4, 5 or 6 people.

People requests cars in groups of 1 to 6. People in the same group want to ride
on the same car. You can take any group at any car that has enough empty seats
for them. If it's not possible to accommodate them, they're willing to wait until 
there's a car available for them. Once a car is available for a group
that is waiting, they should ride. 

Once they get a car assigned, they will journey until the drop off, you cannot
ask them to take another car (i.e. you cannot swap them to another car to
make space for another group).

In terms of fairness of trip order: groups should be served as fast as possible,
but the arrival order should be kept when possible.
If group B arrives later than group A, it can only be served before group A
if no car can serve group A.

For example: a group of 6 is waiting for a car and there are 4 empty seats at
a car for 6; if a group of 2 requests a car you may take them in the car.
This may mean that the group of 6 waits a long time,
possibly until they become frustrated and leave.

## Evaluation rules

This challenge has a partially automated scoring system. This means that before
it is seen by the evaluators, it needs to pass a series of automated checks
and scoring.

### Checks

All checks need to pass in order for the challenge to be reviewed.

- The `acceptance` test step in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` must pass in master before you
submit your solution. We will not accept any solutions that do not pass or omit
this step. This is a public check that can be used to assert that other tests 
will run successfully on your solution. **This step needs to run without 
modification**
- _"further tests"_ will be used to prove that the solution works correctly. 
These are not visible to you as a candidate and will be run once you submit 
the solution

### Scoring

There is a number of scoring systems being run on your solution after it is 
submitted. It is ok if these do not pass, but they add information for the
reviewers.

## API

To simplify the challenge and remove language restrictions, this service must
provide a REST API which will be used to interact with it.

This API must comply with the following contract:

### GET /status

Indicate the service has started up correctly and is ready to accept requests.

Responses:

* **200 OK** When the service is ready to receive requests.

### PUT /cars

Load the list of available cars in the service and remove all previous data
(reset the application state). This method may be called more than once during
the life cycle of the service.

**Body** _required_ The list of cars to load.

**Content Type** `application/json`

Sample:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "seats": 4
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "seats": 6
  }
]
```

Responses:

* **200 OK** When the list is registered correctly.
* **400 Bad Request** When there is a failure in the request format, expected
  headers, or the payload can't be unmarshalled.

### POST /journey

A group of people requests to perform a journey.

**Body** _required_ The group of people that wants to perform the journey

**Content Type** `application/json`

Sample:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "people": 4
}
```

Responses:

* **200 OK** or **202 Accepted** When the group is registered correctly
* **400 Bad Request** When there is a failure in the request format or the
  payload can't be unmarshalled.

### POST /dropoff

A group of people requests to be dropped off. Whether they traveled or not.

**Body** _required_ A form with the group ID, such that `ID=X`

**Content Type** `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

Responses:

* **200 OK** or **204 No Content** When the group is unregistered correctly.
* **404 Not Found** When the group is not to be found.
* **400 Bad Request** When there is a failure in the request format or the
  payload can't be unmarshalled.

### POST /locate

Given a group ID such that `ID=X`, return the car the group is traveling
with, or no car if they are still waiting to be served.

**Body** _required_ A url encoded form with the group ID such that `ID=X`

**Content Type** `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

**Accept** `application/json`

Responses:

* **200 OK** With the car as the payload when the group is assigned to a car. See below for the expected car representation 
```json
  {
    "id": 1,
    "seats": 4
  }
```

* **204 No Content** When the group is waiting to be assigned to a car.
* **404 Not Found** When the group is not to be found.
* **400 Bad Request** When there is a failure in the request format or the
  payload can't be unmarshalled.

## Tooling

At Cabify, we use Gitlab and Gitlab CI for our backend development work. 
In this repo you may find a [.gitlab-ci.yml](./.gitlab-ci.yml) file which
contains some tooling that would simplify the setup and testing of the
deliverable. This testing can be enabled by simply uncommenting the final
acceptance stage. Note that the image build should be reproducible within
the CI environment.

Additionally, you will find a basic Dockerfile which you could use a
baseline, be sure to modify it as much as needed, but keep the exposed port
as is to simplify the testing.

:warning: Avoid dependencies and tools that would require changes to the 
`acceptance` step of [.gitlab-ci.yml](./.gitlab-ci.yml), such as 
`docker-compose`

:warning: The challenge needs to be self-contained so we can evaluate it. 
If the language you are using has limitations that block you from solving this 
challenge without using a database, please document your reasoning in the 
readme and use an embedded one such as sqlite.

You are free to use whatever programming language you deem is best to solve the
problem but please bear in mind we want to see your best!

You can ignore the Gitlab warning "Cabify Challenge has exceeded its pipeline 
minutes quota," it will not affect your test or the ability to run pipelines on
Gitlab.

## Requirements

- The service should be as efficient as possible.
  It should be able to work reasonably well with at least $`10^4`$ / $`10^5`$ cars / waiting groups.
  Explain how you did achieve this requirement.
- You are free to modify the repository as much as necessary to include or remove
  dependencies, subject to tooling limitations above.
- Document your decisions using MRs or in this very README adding sections to it,
  the same way you would be generating documentation for any other deliverable.
  We want to see how you operate in a quasi real work environment.

## Feedback

In Cabify, we really appreciate your interest and your time. We are highly 
interested on improving our Challenge and the way we evaluate our candidates.
